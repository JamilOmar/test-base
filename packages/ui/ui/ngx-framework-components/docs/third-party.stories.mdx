# Tenant Switching

The switch tenant functionality in ngx-framework-components is a more specific implementation of 
ngx-core-services version designed to meet the needs of the metadata ui application. 

Please read how to setup your application for the switch tenant functionality before following the more 
specific implementation below.
[https://github.com/LabShare/ngx-core-services/tree/master/projects/ngx-core-services/src/lib/tenant#tenant-switching-overview](https://github.com/LabShare/ngx-core-services/tree/master/projects/ngx-core-services/src/lib/tenant#tenant-switching-overview)


The switch tenant functionality in ngx-framework-components works in conjunction with the 
[event service](https://github.com/LabShare/ngx-core-services/tree/master/projects/ngx-core-services/src/lib/events).
One example is a host app that subscribes to `EventKeys.SelectTenant` event and `CoreServicesEventKeys.SwitchTenant` 
event. If any of those events are published, it calls the switch tenant function to initiate that process. 
`EventKeys.SelectTenant` event is part of the [left menu component](https://github.com/LabShare/ngx-base-components/tree/master/projects/ngx-base-components/src/lib/components/left-menu) 
in ngx-base-components while `CoreServicesEventKeys.SwitchTenant` 
event is a general [event](https://github.com/LabShare/ngx-core-services/blob/master/projects/ngx-core-services/src/lib/global/global.keys.ts) used to switch between tenants.

The functionality is located in [TenantManager Service](https://github.com/LabShare/ngx-framework-components/blob/master/projects/ngx-framework-components/src/lib/services/tenant.manager.service.ts).
The relevant functions are `handleSelectTenantEvent` and `switchTenant`. `handleSelectTenantEvent` function
takes the event name parameter and route parameter(after authorization the route to redirect to the home page of the new tenant).
It then calls the `switchTenant` function. To use this functuonality you have to have `tenantId` 
parameter in your routing configuration.

To setup the functionality, add the following code in your root app.component.ts file:

```ts
ngOnInit(): void {
    const homeRoute = `{your-home-page-tenant-route}`;

    this.tenantManagerService.handleSelectTenantEvent(CoreServicesEventKeys.SwitchTenant, homeRoute);
}
```
